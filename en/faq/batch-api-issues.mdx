## Concurrency Limits

### What are the concurrency limits for Batch API?

Batch API concurrency limits are separate from existing per-model concurrency limits. Batch API introduces two new types of limits:

**File Limits:**
- A single Batch file contains at most 50,000 requests and does not exceed 100M
- Vector models (Embedding-2, Embedding-3) Batch file request quantity is limited to no more than 10,000 times

**Queue Limits:**
Each model has a maximum Batch queue limit. When the request queue limit is reached, please wait for current tasks to complete before submitting new tasks.

| Model | Batch Queue Limit |
|-------|------------------|
| GLM-4-Flash | 10 million |
| GLM-4-Air | 10 million |
| GLM-3-Turbo | 2 million |
| Embedding-2 | 2 million |
| Embedding-3 | 2 million |
| GLM-4-Plus | 2 million |
| GLM-4-0520 | 500,000 |
| GLM-4 | 500,000 |
| Cogview-3 | 30,000 |
| CogVideoX | 10,000 |
| GLM-4V | 10,000 |

## Real-name Authentication Requirements

### How to perform real-name authentication before calling Batch API?

1. Visit the real-name authentication page
2. Choose personal or enterprise authentication
3. Submit authentication materials
4. Wait for approval

## Expiration Handling

### How is Batch expiration handled?

If a Batch cannot be completed in time, the batch will be marked as expired; uncompleted requests in the batch will be canceled. For completed requests in the batch, users can obtain them through files and need to pay for the fees consumed by these requests.

**Expiration Handling Mechanism:**
- Uncompleted requests are automatically canceled
- Completed requests can be normally retrieved
- Billing based on actual consumption
