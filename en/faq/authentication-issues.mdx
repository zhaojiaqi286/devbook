# Authentication Issues

This page summarizes common questions and solutions encountered by users when performing identity verification on the Z.AI large model open platform.

## Authentication Types

### What's the difference between personal and enterprise authentication accounts?

Enterprise authentication accounts and personal authentication accounts have different authentication methods and require different authentication materials.

**Enterprise Authentication Account Advantages:**
- Developers who complete enterprise authentication can enjoy Zhipu enterprise benefits, see: User Benefits
- Developers who complete enterprise authentication can recharge their accounts through corporate bank transfers
- We strongly recommend that enterprise accounts do not use personal identity for personal real-name authentication to avoid account login information loss or unnecessary disputes due to personnel changes or handovers

### Can I use the API without real-name authentication?

Currently, calling the API does not mandatory require real-name authentication, but to ensure your account security, we recommend that you perform real-name authentication.

## Authentication Changes

Enterprise real-name accounts do not support changing to personal accounts. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Personal real-name accounts can be changed to enterprise real-name accounts. You can visit the real-name authentication page, click the "Change to Enterprise Authentication" button to change your account authentication type.

## Overseas Authentication

The platform supports overseas enterprises for authentication. You need to select overseas enterprise on the real-name authentication page and upload relevant authentication materials.

Each enterprise/person can authenticate multiple accounts with real names. Currently, there is no limit on the number of authentications.
