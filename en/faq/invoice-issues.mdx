# Invoice Issues

This page summarizes common questions and solutions encountered by users when applying for invoices on the Z.AI large model open platform.

## Invoice Application

### How to apply for an invoice?

Regarding invoice issuance, you can complete the process through the platform's self-service system. Issue immediately

**Invoice Mode:**
- Invoice based on actual consumption amount
- Invoiceable amount = User's consumed cash amount
- Invoice scope can be selected: API inference "bills" from T-1 month and earlier & product resource package purchase "orders" from T-1 day and earlier

**Application Steps:**
1. Log in to platform console
2. Enter invoice management page
3. Select invoice scope and amount
4. Fill in invoice information
5. Submit application
6. Wait for issuance completion

## Invoice Rules

### Can invoices be issued based on recharge amount?

Currently, the platform only supports invoicing based on consumption amount, not recharge amount. Thank you for your understanding and support.

**Invoice Principles:**
- Only consumed amounts can be invoiced
- Unconsumed recharge amounts cannot be invoiced
- Ensure invoice amounts match actual usage

### Can invoices be issued when the user account is in arrears?

If a user account is in arrears, some invoices cannot be issued.

**Example:**
- If a user's April consumption amount does not involve arrears, but May consumption involves arrears
- The user can issue an April bill but cannot issue a May bill
- The May bill can be issued after the arrears amount is paid

**Solution:**
1. Pay the arrears amount
2. Wait for account status to return to normal
3. Reapply for invoice issuance

## Invoice Receipt

### How long does it take to receive an invoice? How to receive and download?

**Invoice Delivery:**
- Invoices will be sent to your submitted email within 3-7 working days
- You can download through the link in the email
- If not received after the deadline, contact online customer service/submit a ticket

**Receipt Methods:**
1. Receive electronic invoice via email
2. Download through email link
3. Download from platform console

**Notes:**
- Ensure email address is correct
- Check spam folder
- Download and save invoices promptly

## Enterprise Information Changes

### How to operate if I don't want to use the current certified enterprise real-name information for invoicing?

You can change the platform enterprise real-name information on the enterprise real-name change page. After approval, you can issue invoices based on the new enterprise header.

**Change Process:**
1. Visit enterprise real-name change page
2. Submit new enterprise information
3. Upload relevant supporting materials
4. Wait for approval
5. Use new enterprise information for invoicing

**Important Reminder:**
If a user account undergoes enterprise real-name entity change (enterprise a->enterprise b), i.e., the unified social credit code changes, then after becoming enterprise b, the user cannot issue invoices for consumption amounts from enterprise a's period (historical invoicing can be completed first before making entity changes).

**Recommended Operation Order:**
1. First issue invoices for historical consumption
2. Then make enterprise entity changes
3. Avoid invoice issuance problems

## Invoice Types

**Invoice Types:**
- VAT ordinary invoice (electronic)
