## <Icon icon="arrow-down-from-line" iconType="solid" color="#3890ff" size={28} />   Detailed Introduction

<Steps>
  <Step title="More Accurate Visual Description Capability" titleSize="h3">
    GLM-4V-Plus-0111 achieves deep fusion of visual-language features without sacrificing performance in any NLP tasks. Benefiting from the advantage of native resolution input and continuous hallucination optimization through the data flywheel, it possesses lower hallucination rates and more comprehensive visual content description capabilities.

    In addition to detailed description capabilities, GLM-4V-Plus-0111 can also classify image and video data, generate titles, and add tags. Users can improve the processing efficiency of image and video data or build automated visual data workflows through custom prompts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Precise Temporal Perception Ability" iconType="regular" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h3">
    Unlike images, video data has an additional temporal dimension. Most other visual understanding models do not have temporal perception or temporal question-answering capabilities because they do not receive timestamp information as input. The temporal question-answering capability of GLM-4V-Plus-0111 can help us quickly locate the time points where specific events occur, thereby realizing semantic segmentation of videos and automated video editing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Precise Temporal Perception Ability" iconType="regular" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h3">
    When image resolution or video frame rate is too low, even humans cannot perceive subtle changes in the video. GLM-4V-Plus-0111 has more refined action understanding capabilities and can accurately parse visual details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Excellent Multimodal Understanding Ability" iconType="regular" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h3">
    GLM-4V-Plus-0111 possesses excellent multimodal understanding capabilities and can process up to 5 images simultaneously. Through variable resolution technology, GLM-4V-Plus-0111 can adapt to more video lengths and resolutions, supporting video understanding for up to 2 hours, breaking the upper limit of video processing and expanding the business scenarios of visual understanding models.
